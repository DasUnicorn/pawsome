## Design

### Colour Scheme

The design scheme for the Pawsome Detective Agency website draws inspiration from the timeless and classic style of the legendary Sherlock Holmes, which is characterized by a rich blend of deep greens and luxurious gold accents.
The hope is that the design choices resonate with the charm of a bygone era while offering a modern and accessible platform where users can explore the detective services and engage with captivating content. The blend of green, dark green, and gold serves as a nod to the classic past while guiding us toward an exciting and colorful future.
The colours match with the forrest themed pictures, which show Kasimir on multiple advantures.

### Typography

As font for the genaral Text "Inter" was chosen. The design is clean and easy to read with a very good support for latin characters.
For the Headings I switched to "Lalezar". It works very well with the features of "Inter", but gives a bolder and bigger look to let the headings stand out.
The headlines contain animal puns. To make them clear and let them stand out, part of the Headings switch to "Kaushan Script".

### Imagery

The pictures used for this website show the owner of the detective agency himself. Kasimir showcases what he has to offer and introduces himself as the product through the Imagery.
The Images align with the colours of the site in general and give an advantarous feeling.

### Wireframes

All Wireframes are made with Balsamiq

### Design

To set the Website to life and experiment with colours and pictures, I designed the Project in Figma.
This Design was shown to the customer Kasimir and get his feedback.
