## Design

### Colour Scheme

The design scheme for the Pawsome Detective Agency website draws inspiration from the timeless and classic style of the legendary Sherlock Holmes, which is characterized by a rich blend of deep greens and luxurious gold accents.
The hope is that the design choices resonate with the charm of outdoor nature while offering a modern and accessible platform where users can explore the detective services and engage with captivating content.
The blend of green, dark green, and gold serves as a nod to the  themed pictures, which show Kasimir on multiple .

![Colour Scheme](/assets/img/readme/colors.png)

### Typography

As font for the  Text "Inter" was chosen. The design is clean and easy to read with a very good support for  characters.
For the  switched to "Lalezar". It works very well with the features of "Inter", but gives a bolder and bigger look to let the headings stand out.
The headlines contain animal puns. To make them clear and let them stand out, part of the Headings switch to "Kaushan Script".

### Imagery

The pictures used for this website show the owner of the detective agency himself. Kasimir showcases what he has to offer and introduces himself as the product through the Imagery.
The Images align with the colours of the site in general and give an adventurous feeling.
My sister took the images on a walk with Kasimir.

### Wireframes

All Wireframes are made with Figma.

#### Desktop:

#### Mobile:

<img src="/assets/img/readme/wireframe-mobile.png" alt="Wireframe of Mobile Version" width="300"/>


### Design

To set the Website to life and experiment with colours and pictures, I designed the Project in Figma.
This Design was shown to the customer Kasimir to get his feedback.

## Features

![Reviews](/assets/img/readme/reviews-mobile.png)

#### Contact

![Mail Form](/assets/img/readme/mail.png)

### Future Implementations

#### Calender
It would be create to see Kasimirs Calender directly on the website to know how busy he is and when to expect his team to have time for new requests.

#### Blog
For even more information on what to aspect from the Pawsome Detectives, they could add a blog to tell the stories about their past adventures.

#### Events and Workshops
To boost the familiarity and the prominence of the Detective Agency, Kasimir could start Events on how to find missing pieces, or take better care of your things. Events could be promoted on the Website.

#### Price Table
Not everything needs an individual price. But some specific Prizes and Price Ranges could be displayed to show the possible customers what to expect when discussing payments. This could filter potential clients beforehand.

#### Hiring
A career site could show open job opportunities to grow the Agency and attract other workers to join Kasimirs Team.

### Accessibility

#### Fonts and Font Sizes

I tried to choose fonts that are easy to read. The font sizes are coded in em and REM, to make them easily adjustable by the user themselves.

#### Pictures

Pictures that show information, or provide context are provided with alt texts.
background Pictures that do not provide information, don't.

#### Colors

All colours and colour-text-combinations are tested for contrast and visibility. They went through a change due to accessibility concerns after the design phase.

#### Structural HTML

The structure of html makes the website possible to navigate by keyboard. When pressing the tab key, all interactive content can be reached.

<img src="/assets/img/readme/w3c-ccs-result.png" alt="Results Jigsaw validator" width="500">


#### W3C Validator

It shows no errors.

<img src="/assets/img/readme/html-check.png" alt="Results W3C validator" width="500">

#### Lighthouse

![Lighthouse result](/assets/img/readme/lighthouse.png) 

#### Accessibility
The result of the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool shows 12 Errors and 4 contrast arrows.

8 X Empty form label and 4 X Multiple form labels

* 8 empty and 4 multiple form labels are errors concerning the mobile gallery. Currently, at the mobile version the gallery is designed as a CSS only version. To make this possible, labels are used in unintended ways. This was hard to use when testing with a screen reader.
The better solution would be to build this gallery with javascript and making it possible to slide on the touchscreen as well in the future.

<img src="/assets/img/readme/empty-formlabel.png" alt="Results WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool" width="500">

4 X Contrast Errors

* The 5 stars on the reviews have low contrast that don't meet the Accessibility criteria. Since this is a decorative element only that doesn't add more information to the review itself, I stayed with the low contrast colour for design reasons.

## Ongoing Bugs

### Mail Form doesn't send an email
Since this is a html / css only project, the mail form doesn't send an actual email.

### Review Gallery on small mobile
The review cards on very small mobile devices might be cropped.

## Fixed Bugs
When creating this website, I encountered a lot of aspects that needed fixing. All of them can be found in the github commit-messages with the title including "fix". Here are some examples of bugs I fixed a long the way.

### Label seems to drop in line with the input
* Description: On the mid sized screen <1000 && >600 - check the form, "Email:" label seems to drop in line with the input.

<img src="/assets/img/readme/bug1.png" alt="Label in same line as input.">

* The Problem: The browser displays the content of the mailform simple in order. Because the width of the input field is set to 90%, in the given size range the label text fits next to the input form and get dispays this way.

* Fix: Flexbox is a way to tell the browser how to align multiple items. By displaying the form item as a flex element, I can say that all the items should be displayed in a coloumn, each element above the other.

<img src="/assets/img/readme/bug1-fix.png" alt="Label on top of input.">
<img src="/assets/img/readme/sbltext.png" alt="Code sample Mailform." width="300">

### Mobile Navabar isn't centered
* Description: The navbar, on mobile views is a little off centre.

<img src="/assets/img/readme/bug2.png" alt="Mobile Menue is of.">

* The Problem: The items of the navigatinbar are only centeres in height, but not in width.

* Fix: This was easily fixed by adding an "justify-content: center;" to the nav element.
