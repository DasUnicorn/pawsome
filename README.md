## Design

### Colour Scheme

The design scheme for the Pawsome Detective Agency website draws inspiration from the timeless and classic style of the legendary Sherlock Holmes, which is characterized by a rich blend of deep greens and luxurious gold accents.
The hope is that the design choices resonate with the charm of outdoor nature while offering a modern and accessible platform where users can explore the detective services and engage with captivating content.
The blend of green, dark green, and gold serves as a nod to the  themed pictures, which show Kasimir on multiple .

![Colour Scheme](/assets/img/readme/colors.png)

### Typography

As font for the  Text "Inter" was chosen. The design is clean and easy to read with a very good support for  characters.
For the  switched to "Lalezar". It works very well with the features of "Inter", but gives a bolder and bigger look to let the headings stand out.
The headlines contain animal puns. To make them clear and let them stand out, part of the Headings switch to "Kaushan Script".

### Imagery

The pictures used for this website show the owner of the detective agency himself. Kasimir showcases what he has to offer and introduces himself as the product through the Imagery.
The Images align with the colours of the site in general and give an adventurous feeling.
My sister took the images on a walk with Kasimir.

### Wireframes

All Wireframes are made with Figma.

#### Desktop:

#### Mobile:

### Design

To set the Website to life and experiment with colours and pictures, I designed the Project in Figma.
This Design was shown to the customer Kasimir to get his feedback.

## Features

### General Features

To navigate the website easily, the navigation bar on the top takes you to all parts of the site.

The Footer shows the imprint of the website, to show who stands behind the project and set the structure applied by law.

![Header](/assets/img/readme/header.png)

![Portfolio Mobile](/assets/img/readme/offers-mobile.png)

Some of Kasimirs customers  made reviews, which are displayed.
To save space in the mobile version, instead of displayed them all, the customer can scroll through them if they like to.

#### Contact

To reach Kasimir directly the website provides a mail form.

![Mail Form](/assets/img/readme/mail.png)

### Future Implementations

#### Calender
It would be create to see Kasimirs Calender directly on the website to know how busy he is and when to expect his team to have time for new requests.

#### Blog
For even more information on what to aspect from the Pawsome Detectives, they could add a blog to tell the stories about their past adventures.

#### Events and Workshops
To boost the familiarity and the prominence of the Detective Agency, Kasimir could start Events on how to find missing pieces, or take better care of your things. Events could be promoted on the Website.

#### Price Table
Not everything needs an individual price. But some specific Prizes and Price Ranges could be displayed to show the possible customers what to expect when discussing payments. This could filter potential clients beforehand.

#### Hiring
A career site could show open job opportunities to grow the Agency and attract other workers to join Kasimirs Team.

### Accessibility

#### Fonts and Font Sizes

I tried to choose fonts that are easy to read. The font sizes are coded in em and REM, to make them easily adjustable by the user themselves.

#### Pictures

Pictures that show information, or provide context are provided with alt texts.
background Pictures that do not provide information, don't.

#### Colors

All colours and colour-text-combinations are tested for contrast and visibility. They went through a change due to accessibility concerns after the design phase.

#### Structural HTML

The structure of html makes the website possible to navigate by keyboard. When pressing the tab key, all interactive content can be reached.

## Testing
### Manual Testing

##### Jigsaw CSS Validator
The CSS code was validated using W3C Jigsaw CSS Validator.

![Results CSS](/assets/img/readme/w3c-ccs-result.png) 


#### W3C Validator
Every page of the website was validated using the W3C tool.
It shows no errors.

![Results](/assets/img/readme/html-check.png) 

#### Lighthouse

The lighthouse score for the website was used, when testing for performance, best practice and accessibility.
![Lighthouse result](/assets/img/readme/lighthouse.png) 

#### Accessibility
The result of the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool shows 12 Errors and 4 contrast arrows.
The contrast errors are in the stars of each review. Since they are just decorative object and it's not important if people can see them, I didn't fix this issue.
The 12 Errors apply to labels in the code used for the mobile display animation of multiple reviews.

![Results WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool ](/assets/img/readme/wave.png) 

![Results WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool ](/assets/img/readme/wave-error.png) 

### Accessibility concerns

I need to do more research to check the accessibility on some parts of the site. Currently, at the mobile version the gallery is designed as a CSS only version. To make this possible, labels are used in unintended ways. This shows up in the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool, and was hard to use when testing with a screen reader.
The better solution would be to build this gallery with javascript and making it possible to slide on the touchscreen as well.

On Desktop, portfolio aspects are only shown when hovering over them. As [W3 noted](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html): "Content which appears on hover can be difficult or impossible to perceive if a user is required to keep their mouse pointer over the trigger." This should be adjusted in the next version (see future Adjustments).

### Full Testing

Full testing was performed on the following devices:

* Laptop:
  * Dell XPS
* Mobile Devices:
  * Iphone 12
  * Motorola Moto G

Each device tested the site using the following browsers:

* Google Chrome
* Safari (mobile only)
* Firefox

## Bugs

### Mail Form doesn't send an email
Since this is a html / css only project, the mail form doesn't send an actual email.

### Review Gallery on small mobile
The review cards on very small mobile devices might be cropped.


## Future Adjustments

After realizing the design, there is the possibility to miss the portfolio content when browsing on the desktop. Since Text is only displaying when hovering over it, it looks more like a picture gallery and you could easily miss the content when scrolling with your mouse on the side.
This is a design decision that should completely be abolished and redo differently. Maybe with more of a card design that has a picture and a header visible.
