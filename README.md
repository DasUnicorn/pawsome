## Design

### Colour Scheme

The design scheme for the Pawsome Detective Agency website draws inspiration from the timeless and classic style of the legendary Sherlock Holmes, which is characterized by a rich blend of deep greens and luxurious gold accents.
The hope is that the design choices resonate with the charm of a bygone era while offering a modern and accessible platform where users can explore the detective services and engage with captivating content. The blend of green, dark green, and gold serves as a nod to the classic past while guiding us toward an exciting and colorful future.
The colours match with the forrest themed pictures, which show Kasimir on multiple advantures.

### Typography

As font for the genaral Text "Inter" was chosen. The design is clean and easy to read with a very good support for latin characters.
For the Headings I switched to "Lalezar". It works very well with the features of "Inter", but gives a bolder and bigger look to let the headings stand out.
The headlines contain animal puns. To make them clear and let them stand out, part of the Headings switch to "Kaushan Script".

### Imagery

The pictures used for this website show the owner of the detective agency himself. Kasimir showcases what he has to offer and introduces himself as the product through the Imagery.
The Images align with the colours of the site in general and give an advantarous feeling.
My sister made the images on a walk with Kasimir.

### Wireframes

All Wireframes are made with Figma.

### Design

To set the Website to life and experiment with colours and pictures, I designed the Project in Figma.
This Design was shown to the customer Kasimir to get his feedback.

### Accessibility

#### Fonts and Font Sizes

I tried to choose fonts that are easy to read. The font sizes are coded in em and rem, to make them easly adjustable by the user themself.

#### Pictures

Pictures are provided with alt texts.
Backround Pictures that do not provide information don't.

#### Colors

All colours and colour-text-combinations are tested for contrast and visibility. They went through a change due to accessability concerns after the design phase.

#### Structural HTML

The structure of html makes the website navigatable by keyboard. When pressing the tab key, all interactive contant can be reaches.

The lighthouse score for the website was used, when testing for performance, best practice and accessibility.
![Lighthouse result](/assets/img/readme/lighthouse.png) 

### Accessibility
The result of the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool shows 12 Errors and 4 contrast arrows.
The contrast errors are in the stars of each review. Since they are just decorative object and it's not important if people can see them, I did't fix this issue.
The 12 Errors apply to labels in the code used for the mobile display animation of multiple reviews.
